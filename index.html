                    <h2>Educational History</h2>
                    <p>Being raised in Esterhazy, I took elementary school at P.J. Gillen School and high school in
                        Esterhazy High School. It was there that I first took Computer Science (as well as Communications
                        Media). In high school, I learned my first few programming languages; Java, Visual Basic, and HTML. 
                        I also learned how to use Excel and Access there. I took Computer Science every year that I could, 
                        and the fact that I got good marks in it really showed that you tend to do better at things that 
                        you enjoy!</p>

                    <p>After high school, I entered the Computer Systems Technology program in Sask Polytech's Regina Campus. At 
                        first I mainly was shaking off rust from high school, but soon enough I was learning about things like 
                        operating systems (specifically Windows 10 and Windows Server in-depth) and networking appliances. 
                        For Year 2 of CST I moved to Saskatoon (transfering to Saskpoly's Saskatoon 
                        Campus) and continued learning about more IT sectors (like the rabbit hole that is Security, SCCM, 
                        Server Manager, and working in collaborative teams for full-stack development projects... basically just 
                        a bunch of programmers working together to make a website that can do all sorts of things). My resume goes 
                        more in-depth on the projects I've worked on. 
                        So far I haven't found a subject that I don't want to know more about. I like trying to replicate some 
                        of the things that I learn in school, like setting up multiple computers inside my computer (aka virtual 
                        machines), building my own computer (something that I take way too much pride in) and coding my own side 
                        projects (you could probably consider this website one of them). I intend to expand my IT skills across 
                        several sectors, so I'm never entirely out of my element.</p>

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Ever since high school Computer Science (and Communications Media), I've been fascinated by the
                            things that computers are capable of. I took Computer Science every year that I could. My high school Computer 
                            Science teacher was my idol growing up, so in the end I chose to pursue a career in the high school subject 
                            that I took the most pride in. Saskpoly has really brightened my horizons in terms of what you do in each
                            sector of IT. Of course, as you might tell, I take the most joy (thus far) in programming and web development,
                            as every other greenhorn IT student does. What I think makes me different from other students is that my
                            curiosity towards IT is more... generalized. I want to know a little bit about everything. Because my idol
                            is my high school teacher, I want to be a tech guru similar to him, but I want to have the industry experience 
                            to one day be the senior IT guy anybody from any sector can come to with questions. That's my ambition. I'm most 
                            confident in my ability to work hard on understanding and completing tasks given to me. If my knowledge falls 
                            short, my determination to learn (aka stubbornness) won't. I'm still enrolled in Saskpoly, and in a few short 
                            months (from the moment I'm writing this), I plan to continue my studies at the University of Saskatchewan.
                            At this moment in my career, with my minimal experience, I'm fully aware that my main goal is to become IT
                            support- where everyone starts.

                    <h3>Several Java Projects</h3>
                    <p>I studied Java in both high school and Saskpoly, so it's the language that I have the most experience in,
                        but because I'm mostly a programmer, it's also naturally the language that I dread the most (because I've
                        seen just about every error it can throw). Java has been a stepping stone towards my mastery of Object-Oriented 
                        Programming. However, more recently I've been working with its sibling language C# and their predecessor C.
                        With that being said, Java's flexibility as a language (in terms of what it can run on) is something that
                        still impresses me. It's a very good language to start with. Saskpoly did well by starting its students off
                        with this language, and not Python. You'll have to excuse the fact that I don't have all of my old projects
                        on hand.

                    <h3>Working w/ Databases</h3>
                    <p>In high school I first learned Excel and Access, and then in Saskpoly, I learned Excel and Access a second
                        time, but a little more advanced. My high school curriculum definitely helped me in this department! I was
                        always able to get high marks in database classes, and that's also including SQL. I've dipped my toes in SQL,
                        as well as PL/SQL (basically the programming language verion of SQL, where you can actually do things that
                        every other langauge can do, like making loops and variables), and TypeORM for backend development. As mentioned
                        in the video, I used Oracle SQL Developer in my SQL class, so I was actually able to run the code there, but
                        in terms of graphic databases, I'm also fairly well-versed in NEO4J because of my bigger Year 2 project I'm
                        currently working on, which is using NEO4J, Nodejs, JavaScript and React. For that project, I use a virtual
                        machine to run NEO4J. Considering that basically any server or website that exists needs a database in order
                        to do anything, I'd say that this was pretty helpful knowledge,
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Big Vue Project (w/ CRUD)</h3>
                    <p>At the end of Year 2 Semester 1, I was tasked with making a complete frontend with Vuejs, and 2 CRUD interfaces.
                        (CRUD meaning it that it gives the user the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete something). 
                        When I was done, I had one of the projects which I'm the most proud of, because of the sheer amount of work I
                        put in, in such a short amount of time. I used Vuejs, Vuex for communication between Vue components, Bootstrap 
                        Vue, and just a basic JSON server for my backend. All in order to make a knockoff Twitter that didn't take itself
                        seriously. But hey, I got marked well on it. Eventually I want to be a seasoned full-stack developer (whether it
                        be professionally or just a hobbyist), so this experience was definitely useful in coming closer to that.

                    <h3>Building A Proposal, Scavenging Hardware</h3>
                    <p>As the final project that was jointed between a Technical Communication class and a Hardware class, we were split
                        into groups and given the assignment to make a hardware proposal for a company that was definitely not just our
                        teacher. Our job was to both find computer parts that satisfy the requirements of the company, and write them
                        into a proposal that was describing what our intention was, why we chose those parts, why we thought they would
                        be the best fit, why they should trust us, and also show that we knew our stuff by incorporating a Table of Contents,
                        Table of Figures, Summary, Formal Introduction, Background, Part Introduction, Product Review for each part,
                        Conclusion... the works. I was the one in the group who handled most of the writing, along with a couple of the parts.
                        My own computer is still far better than what we cooked up with that budget build. Really, I should be incorporating
                        the time and effort I put into building my pc and the trouble I went through into its own part of this website, but
                        that doesn't seem to fit anywhere.

                    <h3>Redesigning Websites</h3>
                    <p>Two other classmates and I were tasked with taking a bad website, redesigning it from scratch, and turning
                        it into a good website. We had to use Bootstrap, and make a mobile version of the website. I want to be proud
                        of this project, because it does look really good- however, it doesn't feel right to be proud of something
                        that's technically already been done by someone. Even if what that someone has done looks laughable. With
                        that said, it was a job well done, and the redesign looked beautiful in the end. The Yale School of Art should
                        probably reconsider their web design strategy. Again, more great skills towards the mastery of the frontend
                        side of web development.

                    <h3>Working With Android</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the Vue project above, you might be able to tell that this was another project that I was able to
                        get creative with. We were tasked with creating an app in Android Studio with a certain amount of functionalities,
                        and despite the fact that I hardly knew anything about Dungeons & Dragons- you know where this is going. In my own
                        style, I made an app that didn't necessarily take itself seriously which had three functionalities: recording
                        characters, rolling dice, and sending you non-threatening notifications to play DnD. I had a bit of fun with it,
                        and it's also a project I'm pretty proud of. Every now and then, I forget about how big mobile development is in
                        the industry, and considering that by the time I write this I've already coded an app in Android Studio and Xamarin,
                        that's something that I can see myself delving into as a future career. In my Xamarin project, coding in C# for an
                        Android application, it felt natural to me. I didn't seem to fall into nearly as many potholes as my fellow
                        classmates (except for, of course, the ones that just the debugger or a simple "if x != NULL" could easily solve).
                        I'll have to think about that one.
